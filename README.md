# Hey there! 👋 I'm Sandesh Bagade

## Frontend Developer | Open Source Enthusiast | Remote Work Advocate

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm a frontend developer with a passion for crafting delightful user experiences and building impactful web applications. Over the past three years, I've had the incredible opportunity to work with startups, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.

### 🚀 Let's Talk Experience

During my journey, I've been fortunate to work with two amazing startups, contributing my skills to develop exceptional web applications from scratch. In my most recent role, I took the lead in frontend development for an Indian startup. Together, we created not one, but two highly successful web applications and a mobile app that garnered a 4.5-star rating and over 100,000 downloads! It's been an exciting ride, and I'm eager to take on new challenges.

### 💡 Open Source & Remote Work

I'm also keen to explore the world of open source and contribute to projects that make a difference. Collaborative coding has always intrigued me, and I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and code for the greater good of the developer community. If you have any exciting open source opportunities, I'm all ears!

And let's not forget about remote work. I'm a big advocate for it! The idea of working from anywhere while collaborating with talented individuals excites me. I've embraced the remote lifestyle, am well-versed in remote collaboration tools, and always enjoy the flexibility and autonomy it brings.
